Setting up a Google Hangout is not obvious, here are the steps I take to create one.

## 1. Create the Hangout On Air

Go to [https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair), and click 'Create Hangout On Air'.

## 2. Configure the Hangout

Set the title, description, start and duration. I also invite the relevant people/circles.

You should see your hangout in a list here: [https://plus.google.com/events](https://plus.google.com/events)

You're all set.

## 3. Start the Hangout

15 minutes or so before the start, go and find the Hangout page. If you're running the Hangout, you must press the `Start` button, simply joining it will not give you the ability to start the broadcast.

## 4. Invite Guests

When starting the Hangout, you have the opportunity to add guests. I believe these people are then able to join in on the conversation.

## 5. Publish Links

When you've started the hangout, you then have an extra link which people can use to join as guests. I usually publish this in gitter/twitter so any other interested parties can join in.

## 6. Broadcast

When you're ready to start, press the `Start Broadcast` button, and viewers will be able to watch your live stream. The video will automatically be saved to YouTube when you're done.
