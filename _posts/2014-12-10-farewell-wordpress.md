I have moved my blog to GitHub.

I'm fed up with wordpress, and prefer the simplicity of Jekyll and git, using GitHub pages for hosting.

The code highlighting is also more pleasant (and supports Julia!).

{% highlight julia %}
function foo()
  println("hello world");
end
{% endhighlight %}

You can [fork my blog](https://github.com/richorama/richorama.github.com) if you like, and use it to create your own.
